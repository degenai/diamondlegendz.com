HOW TO ADD YOUR OWN MIDI FILES
==============================

1. Place your .mid or .midi files in this folder (`midi-player/midis/`).

2. Update `file_list.json` in this folder to include the filenames you just added.
   Example:
   [
       "guile.mid",
       "ken.mid",
       "ryu.mid"
   ]

3. Refresh the MIDI Player page. Your files will appear in the dropdown!

(Note: You can always just drag and drop files directly onto the player without doing this.)
